⚪The website is primarily built with React using tailwind and the website is built with Firebase and mongodb.

⚪Here MongDB is used as the database and this review all service information provided by a user is stored in MongDB database from where a user can be displayed and a normal user can see it.

⚪Here localhost user is used for security purpose so that no unauthorized user or person can view any stored data.

⚪And in the review section, the link of the user's comment user's photo of the service ID is stored so that later in the comment, those reviews can be shown to other users according to each service. Comments are added so that other users can understand who made the comment

⚪Here users can provide their reviews and see how many reviews they have given and from here users can delete reviews.

⚪An unauthorized user will only be able to view reviews of each service but must be logged in to provide reviews and provided login access via email and Google account.

⚪A user can add a service as per his wish to add the service described in the assignment and it will be displayed on all service pages
